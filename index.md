## ABOUT ME
My name is Robert Yamasaki, I am currently a first year software engineering student at RIT. A couple fun facts about myself is that I came all the way to Rochester from California for a change of pace. Although Rochester does not offer as much as my hometown of Los Angeles, I am happy that I am able to go outdoors a lot expecially given the current situation with corona and the wildfires.I attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies back in California and took a lot of APs. A few of my hobbies include playing videosgames(Valorant and Genshin Impact), skating, drawing, listening to music and learning Japanese.

## WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN FROM THE COURSE
- How software engineers work efficiently together
- github tutorial pls (using terminal on mac and such)
- How big projects are split down to make things more efficient
