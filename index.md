## ABOUT ME
My name is Robert Yamasaki, I am currently a first year software engineering student at RIT. A couple fun facts about myself is that I came all the way to Rochester from California for a change of pace. Although Rochester does not offer as much as my hometown of Los Angeles, I am happy that I am able to go outdoors a lot expecially given the current situation with corona and the wildfires.I attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies back in California and took a lot of APs. A few of my hobbies include playing videosgames(Valorant and Genshin Impact), skating, drawing, listening to music and learning Japanese.

## WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN FROM THE COURSE
- How software engineers work efficiently together
- github tutorial pls (using terminal on mac and such)
- How big projects are split down to make things more efficient













## Welcome to GitHub Pages
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rhy2781/pagestest/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rhy2781/pagestest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
